# Spaceterm mobile

A web app for the phone, served by the Spaceterm server and reached over
Tailscale. It is the desktop app with a different host underneath, not a
second client: as much as possible is literally the same code.

## What is shared, and how

| Piece | Desktop | Phone |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol client | `src/shared/server-client.ts` | same |
| `window.api` | `src/shared/client-api.ts` | same |
| Startup, resync, reconnect | `renderer/src/lib/install-api.ts` | same |
| Transport | Electron main's byte pipe to the Unix socket | WebSocket to `src/server/web-gateway.ts` |
| Host (window, perf, system) | preload | `browser-platform.ts` |
| Canvas | `App` | same `App`, plus touch (`useTouchCamera`) |
| A focused terminal | live in its card | the same `TerminalCard`, chromeless, full screen (`TerminalView.tsx`) |
| Ship it | `src/server/ship-it.ts` | same |

The one switch is `surfacePresenterStore`: with `external` set, `App` keeps
every canvas card on snapshots and publishes which terminal is focused, and
`MobileApp` draws it. Focus, unread handling and the camera stay `App`'s.

Phone-only: the gestures, the key row, the composer (dictate → edit → ship),
the surface list, and dictation capture.

## The terminal view

Just the terminal, at a grid that fits the screen. That grid is *borrowed*
(`terminal-borrow-size`): the server keeps the surface's own size as a
persisted `homeSize` and gives it back when the view closes, when the phone
disconnects, or — if the server died mid-borrow — at its next start. A
deliberate resize on the desktop ends the borrow.

Touches never reach xterm (`terminal-gesture.ts`):

| Gesture | Does |
|---|---|
| drag up / down | scrolls — sent as wheel events, so the card's own routing picks the TUI's mouse protocol or the shell's scrollback, as on the desktop |
| flick sideways | back to the canvas |
| tap | the composer, keyboard up |
| long press | the keyboard and the extra-key row, typing straight into the terminal |

On the canvas, a long press on a card is the desktop's ⌘-click: the
quick-actions toolbar. Dictation streams 16 kHz PCM to the server, which
relays it through Voice Operator (`src/server/remote-dictation.ts`) — the only
process that may hold Wispr's rotating tokens.

## Running it

```
npm run mobile:build      # → out/mobile, served by the server on 127.0.0.1:7391
                          #   (the server also rebuilds it in the background on
                          #   startup whenever a source is newer than the build)
npm run mobile:link       # prints the pairing URL (and the tailscale serve step)
```

The gateway binds loopback only and requires the token from
`~/.spaceterm/web-token` on its socket. `tailscale serve --bg 7391` exposes it
to your tailnet with HTTPS, which Safari needs before it will open the
microphone. `SPACETERM_WEB_PORT=0` turns the gateway off.

## Deliberately not done (yet)

- Text size is a constant (`mobile.terminalScale` in localStorage, default
  0.85 — about 55 columns on a 390-pt phone); there is no control for it yet.
- No TTS on the phone and no push notifications.
- A reconnect reloads the page (as the desktop does); drafts and the open
  surface survive it.
